# Data-visualization
This project focuses on visualizing ship performance data to analyze the factors affecting efficiency and revenue. The dataset includes key performance metrics of carrier ships, and the analysis is carried out using three different visualizations. A stacked bar graph is used to compare categorical data, providing a clear representation of distributions across different categories. A heatmap is generated to illustrate the correlations between various performance metrics and revenue, helping to identify potential relationships. Additionally, a scatter plot is used to highlight trends and patterns between key variables. These visualizations collectively provide insights into how different factors influence ship performance and revenue generation.
